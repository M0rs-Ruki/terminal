                  I&apos;m a <strong>Software Developer</strong> with a
                  backend focus, building reliable RESTful APIs and full‑stack
                  applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, and
                  TypeScript, with JWT‑based authentication and responsive
                  interfaces in React, Tailwind, HTML/CSS, and EJS. Strong in
                  data modeling with Mongoose, media handling via Cloudinary
                  integration (storage/CDN), and pragmatic tooling across
                  Git/GitHub, Docker, Postman, and API testing for robust
                  delivery. Comfortable augmenting products with AI/ML libraries
                  (TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas) and shipping to Vercel/Render,
                  guided by a build‑to‑learn mindset and ongoing BCA studies
                  (CGPA 8.93).

                    a new project to the personal lessons learned along the way.
